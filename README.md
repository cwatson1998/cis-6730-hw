# CIS 6730 HW Assignments

## HW 1: Dafny
### Dafny Set-up
Dafny installation instructions can be found here: https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL 
I highly recommend using the VS Code plug-in if you can.

On Tuesday January 31st. I'll give a Dafny demo during class, following tutorial-unfilled.dfy. 
This is an abridged version of the official tutorial, which you can find at https://dafny.org/latest/OnlineTutorial/guide.
I would recommend opening tutorial-unfilled.dfy in VS Code before class so you can tell if your installation
is working, but my demo will assume you haven't read it or any other Dafny resources. You might want to follow along with 
me during the demo as I fill in tutorial-unfilled.dfy. I'll post the filled-in version after class.

### HW
I'll release the HW after class on 1/31 (by uploading it to this repo). It will be due two weeks after that, on 
February 15th. All you need to do is email me (ccwatson@seas.upenn.edu) the .dfy file containing your solution.

I suggest you start early, because tools like Dafny can be very finicky. There will be no normal class on Tuesday 2/7- instead, I'll host office hours during this time. I'll also host office hours by appointment during the assignment period, so if you get stuck, email me.

Happy proving!
