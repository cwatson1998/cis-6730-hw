# CIS 6730 HW Assignments

## HW 1: Dafny
### Dafny Set-up
Dafny installation instructions can be found here: https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL 
I highly recommend using the VS Code plug-in if you can.

On Tuesday January 31st. I'll give a Dafny demo during class, following tutorial-unfilled.dfy. 
This is an abridged version of the official tutorial, which you can find at https://dafny.org/latest/OnlineTutorial/guide.
I would recommend opening tutorial-unfilled.dfy in VS Code before class so you can tell if your installation
is working, but my demo will assume you haven't read it or any other Dafny resources. You might want to follow along with 
me during the demo as I fill in tutorial-unfilled.dfy. I'll post the filled-in version after class.

### HW
I'll release the HW after class on 1/31 (by uploading it to this repo). It will be due two weeks after that, on Wednesday
February 15th (11:59pm). I'll make an assignment on Canvas- all you need to do is upload the .dfy file containing your solution.

I suggest you start early, because tools like Dafny can be very finicky. I'll host office hours by appointmnet during the assignment period.
If you get stuck, email me to set something up. Right after class is convenient, but lots of other times are good too.

Happy proving!
